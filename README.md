# GPA-Comparison

This project demonstrates basic C programming concepts, including the use of structures, function declarations and definitions, header files, and array manipulation. The primary functionality is to compare a set of persons based on their GPA (Grade Point Average) and determine the person with the highest GPA.

<br>

Files Description
<br>
gpa.h: Header file defining the person structure and declarations for two key functions, compareTo and find_the_person.
<br>
main.c: Main module of the program. It tests the functionality by comparing the GPAs of two sample persons.
<br>
gpa.c: Implementation of the functions declared in gpa.h. Contains the logic for comparing GPAs.
<br>
<br>

Functions
<br>
compareTo(struct person p1, struct person p2): Compares two persons and returns the one with the higher GPA.
<br>
find_the_person(struct person persons[], int len): Finds the person with the highest GPA in an array of person.
